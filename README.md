# E-commerce Back End

## Description
A back end server for an e-commerce database which has all the necessary functions and routes to view, add, update, and delete categories, products, and tags related to an e-commerce business. This project aims to build upon the use of NodeJS as well as continue to practice using technologies such as Express, MySQL, and Sequelize. Routes are established to view and manipulate data within the database. The data is structured to match the given models and the models are programmed in a way to show associated data i.e. products within categories and products with certain tags.

## Installation
All necessary packages are included in the package.json and can be installed using the 'npm i' or 'npm install' commands.

## Usage
After installing the necessary packages, the schema must be sourced using MySQL and a .env file with the database name, username, and password must be created. Seed the database using the 'npm run seed' command to initialize the database with some data or add in your own. Start the server using 'npm start' and access the routes using your choice of software. In this case, Insomnia Core was used. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are available for this project.
